## solo swap

![solo-swap](./public/swap.png)

solo swap is a pro-rata swapper that allows users to specify a percentage of their portfolio to swap to global stables. 

solo swap will be callable within a realms instruction, allowing dao members to specify a percentage of the treasury to be liquidated. when the multi-signature is approved, the quote prices for the specified percentage are re-fetched at the latest market prices, eliminating the need to transfer funds out in order to get liquidity.
