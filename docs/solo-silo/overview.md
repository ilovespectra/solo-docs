# solo-silo

solo-silo is an offline ai-powered file browsing app with semantic search capabilities. built with privacy as a core principle, all ai processing happens locally on your machine - no cloud, no data sharing, just you and your memories.

## key features

- **semantic search**: find photos using natural language like "sunset over mountains" or "dogs playing in snow"
- **face recognition**: automatic face detection and clustering to organize photos by people
- **object detection**: identify animals, objects, and scenes in your photos and videos
- **ocr capabilities**: extract and search text from images
- **audio transcription**: transcribe audio and video content locally
- **multiple silos**: create separate collections for different photo libraries
- **100% offline**: all ai models run locally after initial download (~2gb)

## privacy first

silo runs entirely on your machine:
- no data sent to the cloud
- no internet required after setup
- all ai processing happens locally
- your photos stay on your device

## ai models

silo uses state-of-the-art open-source ai models:
- **clip**: semantic embeddings for visual search
- **deepface**: face detection and recognition
- **yolo**: object and animal detection
- **easyocr**: optical character recognition
- **whisper**: audio transcription
- **faiss**: vector similarity search
- **hdbscan**: intelligent face clustering

## use cases

- organize large photo collections without manual tagging
- find specific memories using natural language
- group photos by people automatically
- search for text in images
- discover photos by content (animals, objects, scenes)
- maintain privacy while using powerful ai features
